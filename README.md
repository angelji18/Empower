# Empower


Basic code for moving and changing color of the plinth.
The token is moved acoss the map using the arrow keys and using keys "B" and "G" the density of the color of the plinth can be changed to show variation of ranges of fetecide across different counteries.
Our main aim here was to show using UNITY what we would want to achieve on the hardware.
the file NewBehavior has the code for color chage and
the file ObjectMovement has the code for moving the plinth
We set up the hexmap and named them with some of the countries which would help us show the variations 
we start off by removing the color of the plinth object and setting a glowing light around it to depict the aspiration that it "glows". As we move aross the map we change the intensity of the blue and green colors using B and G keys to show the changes in fetecide rates, the darker the color the higher the rate.
